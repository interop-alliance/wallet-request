/**
 * The `WalletOnboardingQuery` transport vocabulary: the VPR half of "connect a
 * new wallet client over an exchange". An already-enrolled client (the
 * inviter) composes a request body carrying the query and stores it on an
 * ephemeral exchange; a fresh wallet (the enrollee) scans the exchange's
 * interaction URL, classifies the query here, and answers with the onboarding
 * response envelope (`@interop/wallet-core`'s `enrollment` subpath).
 *
 * Vocabulary only -- the enrollment ceremony itself is untouched, and nothing
 * secret crosses the channel: connect-code public halves travel one way, the
 * account pointer and controller the other. The query carries the account's
 * did:webvh `did`, its `spaceId` and `host` (together the account pointer),
 * and the account controller did:key, so the enrollee locates the account
 * without being asked for the account passphrase -- which a passkey-only
 * account does not even have. The inviter already holds all four values.
 *
 * The query names the account but authorizes nothing. A holder of the QR or
 * capability URL gains a world-readable DID log and nothing else; every act on
 * the Space still requires zcaps they do not have, and the rendezvous server
 * that sees the pointer is the same WAS server that hosts the Space and
 * already knows the account DID. Injection by a URL holder remains the real
 * threat, and remains covered by the ceremony's fingerprint / confirmation-
 * code comparison: nothing is authorized before that human check.
 *
 * A wallet that predates the query type finds nothing it can satisfy in such a
 * request (`classifyRequest` reports no DID Auth, no credential queries, and
 * no capability requests) and refuses, rather than degrading into a partial
 * generic flow.
