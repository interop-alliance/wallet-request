/**
 * Composes a Verifiable Presentation to send back to a requester. The VP is
 * signed when DID Authentication was requested (proving control of the holder's
 * DID over the request's `challenge`, and `domain` when the verifier sends
 * one), and unsigned otherwise.
 *
 * Merged from DCW's `app/lib/composeVp.ts` and Freewallet's
 * `src/lib/walletRequest/composeVP.ts`. The signer and holder DID are injected
 * as a {@link PresentationSigner} -- each app resolves them from its own key
 * material -- and the optional zcap / appConnect embedding (grants ride inside
 * the VP, added before signing so a DIDAuth proof covers them) is carried over
 * from Freewallet. The DIDAuth guard follows DCW: `challenge` is required,
 * `domain` is optional (a wallet that needs the stricter "domain always
 * present" invariant enforces it in its own wrapper before calling here).
