/**
 * Framework-agnostic request processing: turns a classified VPR body plus the

 * any delegated zcaps). The response channel (CHAPI `respondWith`, an
 * exchange-URL POST) stays with the caller -- this function only returns data,
 * and assumes the user has already consented and picked which credentials to
 * send.
 *
 * Ported from Freewallet's `src/lib/walletRequest/processRequest.ts` (the pure
 * shape). The two app-specific side effects -- capability delegation and the App
 * Connect branch -- are injected as {@link RequestProcessors} rather than
 * imported, so this layer carries no session / grant-resolution machinery. The
 * signer and holder DID are injected as a {@link PresentationSigner}.
