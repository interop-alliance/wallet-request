/**
 * `@interop/wallet-request`: wallet-request / exchange-protocol handling
 * shared by the Interop wallet apps (DCW and Freewallet).
 *
 * - `types` re-exports the VPR message vocabulary from
 *   `@interop/data-integrity-core` and declares the request-local types (CHAPI
 *   events, the classified-request profile, and the `PresentationSigner` /
 *   `FetchLike` / `RequestProcessors` injection seams).
 * - `parse` / `classify` turn a raw URL, JSON string, or CHAPI event into a
 *   typed message and dispatch on what it asks for.
 * - `matching` filters stored credentials against a QueryByExample (both the
 *   deep matcher and the type/issuer matcher).
 * - `onboarding` is the `WalletOnboardingQuery` transport vocabulary: the
 *   inviter's compose helper and the enrollee's classification, over a query
 *   carrying the account pointer (did:webvh id, `spaceId`, `host`) and the
 *   account controller did:key (the response envelope itself lives in
 *   `@interop/wallet-core`'s `enrollment` subpath, beside the connect code it
 *   carries).
 * - `appKey` is the App Connect app-key credential module: the wire constants,
 *   the matching / minting / legacy re-issue paths, and the store-time
 *   refusal policy.
 * - `presentationSuite` negotiates the response cryptosuite; `composeVp` builds
 *   the (optionally signed, optionally grant-embedding) response VP.
 * - `exchangeClient` is the fetch-injectable VC-API exchange client;
 *   `interactionUrl` resolves VCALM `interaction:` URLs; `interactionRequest`
 *   composes the two into `openInteractionRequest`, the answering wallet's
 *   one-call entry point for an interaction URL.
 * - `ephemeralExchange` is the requester's side of a WAS server's ephemeral
 *   exchange: create one carrying a VPR, poll it (with an optional deadline)
 *   until the wallet answers. `capabilityRequest` composes the zcap-only VPR
 *   a requester stores on it.
 * - `processRequest` is the pure request-to-response pipeline, with the
 *   app-side side effects injected.
 * - `classifyWalletInput` / `handleWalletInput` are the ordered
 *   discrimination every "scan or paste something" entry point runs, with the
 *   per-grammar handlers and the account-convention recognizers injected.
 *
 * The root also exports the logging port: `setLogger` and the `Logger`
 * type. An app wires its logger once at bootstrap; nothing else here
 * touches the console.
