 * Shared types for `@interop/wallet-request`. The Verifiable
 * Presentation Request (VPR) vocabulary itself is owned by
 * `@interop/data-integrity-core` (its `VPR` module) and re-exported here so a
 * request consumer imports one package; this file adds only the request-local
 * types the app sources carried alongside that vocabulary: the CHAPI event
 * shapes, the VC-API exchange reply shape, the classified-request profile, and
 * the injection-seam types (`PresentationSigner`, `FetchLike`,
 * `RequestProcessors`) that keep this layer free of any single app's session /
 * network / consent machinery.
 *
 * Ported from DCW's `app/lib/walletRequestApi.ts` and Freewallet's
 * `src/lib/walletRequest/{types,classify}.ts`.
 *
 * The VPR vocabulary (and the loose-shape guards in `classify` / `matching`) is
 * imported from the `@interop/data-integrity-core/vpr` and `/guards` subpaths
 * rather than the package root: the vocabulary was added to data-integrity-core
 * without a version bump, so the package root can dedup onto an older cached
 * build that predates it, whereas the subpath entry points resolve only against
 * the current build that defines them.
