/**
 * The App Connect app-key credential: a self-issued VC that carries a 32-byte
 * seed an app keeps in the user's wallet so it can open its encrypted data on
 * this and other devices. Unlike an ordinary credential, the issuer and
 * subject are NOT the wallet user's DID -- they are a did:key derived from the
 * seed itself (self-issued by the app key), so the credential validates
 * standalone and the same seed reconstitutes the same identity on every
 * client. The credential is bound to the attested requesting origin
 * (`credentialSubject.origin`) and to the application's canonical URL
 * (`credentialSubject.appUrl`), and matched wallet-side against both, so a
 * phishing origin can neither recover an existing app key nor be handed one
 * minted for another origin, and applications sharing an origin are kept
 * apart by their `appUrl`s.
 *
 * Ported from Freewallet's `src/lib/appKey.ts`, migrated from the
 * `credentialType` / `vocabBase` model to the App Connect spec's `appUrl`
 * model: the type array is a fixed two-entry list, the `@context` is the VC
 * 1.1 context URL followed by the hosted App Connect context URL (identical
 * for every application), and which application a credential belongs to is a
 * claim (`credentialSubject.appUrl`), not a type. See the App Connect spec's
 * App Key Credential section for the normative shape, matching, and minting
 * rules this module implements.
