 * request, and polling that exchange until the answering wallet posts its
 * response. Generic over what the request asks for -- a wallet's onboarding
 * invite stores a `WalletOnboardingQuery` (`onboarding.ts`), a CLI asking for
 * capabilities stores a zcap-only request (`capabilityRequest.ts`). Pure
 * logic: no UI framework, no DOM, and no module-level mutable state; every
 * run is per-instance, cancelled through the caller's `AbortSignal` or the
 * poll's own deadline, with the network transport injected.
 *
 * These routes are deliberately unauthenticated (a capability-URL access model:
 * the exchange URL is the secret, and it travels point-to-point, as a QR code
 * or a printed link), so nothing here signs a request.
